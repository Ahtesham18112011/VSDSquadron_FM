# Task 1: Understanding and implementing Verilog code on FM
## Understanding the verilog code
This is the link of the verilog code for the glowing of blue led in a RGB led present in the FPGA board. [top.v](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/top.v).

The first section of the verilog code says 
* led_red,led_blue,led_green  These are the output wires that controls the clors of RGB led which carries output of logic 1 or 0
* hw_clk  It is a clock that provides clock signals to the module"s timing.
* testwire  it is connected to bit 5  of the frequency counter
