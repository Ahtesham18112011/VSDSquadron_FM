# Task 1: Understanding and implementing Verilog code on FM
## Understanding the verilog code
This is the link of the verilog code for the glowing of blue led in a RGB led present in the FPGA board. [top.v](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/top.v). 
<details>
  <summary>Module Analysis</summary>
The first section of the verilog code says. 
  
1. **led_red,led_blue,led_green**  These are the output wires that controls the clors of RGB led which carries output of logic 1 or 0

2. **hw_clk**  It is a clock that provides clock signals to the module"s timing.

3. **testwire**  it is connected to bit 5 of the frequency counter
